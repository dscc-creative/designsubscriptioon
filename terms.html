                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    ds creative design provides a subscription-based creative service. clients have access to a private request queue where they may submit unlimited design tasks. we process these tasks sequentially (one at a time), aiming for an average turnaround of 48 hours per task or milestone. complex requests (e.g., full pitch decks) may be broken into smaller daily milestones.
                </p>

                <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-4">2. ownership & ip</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    you own it all. upon payment, the client is granted 100% ownership of all original work created by ds creative design, including source files. we retain the right to showcase the work in our portfolio or marketing materials unless a non-disclosure agreement (nda) is signed.
                </p>

                <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-4">3. payments & refunds</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    memberships are billed on a recurring basis (monthly, quarterly, or annually) via stripe. due to the nature of high-touch creative work, <span class="text-black font-bold">we do not offer refunds</span> once work has commenced or a billing cycle has started. you may cancel your subscription at any time to prevent future billing.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    we understand workflow fluctuates. if you do not have active requests, you may "pause" your membership via the billing portal. the remaining days in your billing cycle will be preserved and can be used anytime in the future.

                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    ds creative design is not liable for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages arising from the use of our services or deliverables. while we strive for perfection, it is the client's responsibility to proofread all text and verify all data in final designs before publishing or printing.
